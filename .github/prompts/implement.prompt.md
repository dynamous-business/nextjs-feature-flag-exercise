# Implement Plan

**Plan**: ${input:planPath}

## Your Mission

Execute the plan end-to-end with rigorous self-validation.

**Core Philosophy**: Validation loops catch mistakes early. Run checks after every change. Fix issues immediately.

**Golden Rule**: If validation fails, fix it before moving on. Never accumulate broken state.

---

## Phase 1: LOAD

### Read the Plan

Load the plan file and extract:

- **Summary** - What we're building
- **Patterns to Mirror** - Code to copy from
- **Files to Change** - CREATE/UPDATE list
- **Tasks** - Implementation order
- **Validation Commands** - How to verify

**If plan not found:**
```
Error: Plan not found at the specified path.
Create a plan first: /plan "feature description"
```

---

## Phase 2: PREPARE

### Git State

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status
```

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| On main, clean | Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/{plan-name}` |
| On main, dirty | STOP: "Stash or commit changes first" |
| On feature branch | Use it |

---

## Phase 3: EXECUTE

**For each task in the plan:**

### 3.1 Verify Assumptions

Before writing any code for a task:

- **Read the target file** you're about to create or modify
- **Read adjacent files** — files it imports from, and files that import it
- **Verify the plan's references** — do the functions, interfaces, tables, or endpoints the plan mentions actually exist? Do they match the plan's expectations?
- **If assumptions are wrong**, adapt your approach before implementing. Document what differs from the plan.

### 3.2 Implement

- Read the **MIRROR** file reference and understand the pattern to follow
- Make the change as specified in the plan
- **Check integration**: verify your change connects correctly to adjacent code — do imports resolve? Do callers/callees still work? Does the data flow correctly across boundaries?

### 3.3 Validate Immediately

**After EVERY task:**

```bash
pnpm run build
```

**If it fails:**
1. Read the error
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run validation
4. Only proceed when passing

### 3.4 Track Progress

```
Task 1: CREATE src/x.ts ✅
Task 2: UPDATE src/y.ts ✅
```

**If you deviate from the plan**, document what changed and why.

---

## Phase 4: VALIDATE

### Run All Checks

```bash
# Type check
pnpm run build

# Lint
pnpm run lint

# Tests
pnpm test
```

**All must pass with zero errors.**

### Write Tests

You MUST write tests for new code:
- Every new function needs at least one test
- Error cases and edge cases need tests
- Update existing tests if behavior changed
- **Test across boundaries** — don't just test functions in isolation. If you added an API endpoint, test that the endpoint returns the correct response shape and data. If you added a service method, test that it integrates correctly with its callers.

**If tests fail:**
1. Determine: bug in implementation or test?
2. Fix the actual issue
3. Re-run until green

### End-to-End Verification

**After all static checks and tests pass, re-read the plan and check for end-to-end testing instructions.** If the plan includes end-to-end testing steps, you MUST execute every single one of them systematically. Do not skip any.

For each end-to-end test specified in the plan:

1. **Start the application** — spin up dev servers, databases, or whatever the project requires
2. **Execute the test exactly as described** — follow the plan's instructions for what to test and how
3. **Verify the expected outcome** — confirm the result matches what the plan says should happen
4. **If a test fails**, fix the issue and re-run until it passes before moving to the next one

**This is critical.** Missing end-to-end testing is not acceptable. Static checks and unit tests are not sufficient — the plan's end-to-end tests verify the feature works as a whole.

## Phase 5: REPORT

### Create Report

**Output path**: `.agents/reports/{plan-name}-report.md`

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/reports
```

```markdown
# Implementation Report

**Plan**: `{plan-path}`
**Branch**: `{branch-name}`
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Summary

{Brief description of what was implemented}

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | File | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 1 | {description} | `src/x.ts` | ✅ |
| 2 | {description} | `src/y.ts` | ✅ |

## Validation Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Type check | ✅ |
| Lint | ✅ |
| Tests | ✅ ({N} passed) |

## Files Changed

| File | Action | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
| `src/x.ts` | CREATE | +{N} |
| `src/y.ts` | UPDATE | +{N}/-{M} |

## Deviations from Plan

{List any deviations with rationale, or "None"}

## Tests Written

| Test File | Test Cases |
|-----------|------------|
| `src/x.test.ts` | {list} |
```

### Archive Plan

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/plans/completed
mv $ARGUMENTS .agents/plans/completed/
```

---

## Phase 6: OUTPUT

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

**Plan**: `{plan-path}`
**Branch**: `{branch-name}`
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Validation

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Type check | ✅ |
| Lint | ✅ |
| Tests | ✅ |

### Files Changed

- {N} files created
- {M} files updated
- {K} tests written

### Deviations

{Summary or "Implementation matched the plan."}

### Artifacts

- Report: `.agents/reports/{name}-report.md`
- Plan archived: `.agents/plans/completed/`

### Next Steps

1. Review the report
2. Create PR: `gh pr create`
3. Merge when approved
```

## Handling Failures

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Type check fails | Read error, fix type issue, re-run |
| Tests fail | Fix implementation or test, re-run |
| Lint fails | Run `pnpm run lint --fix`, then manual fixes |
| Build fails | Check error output, fix and re-run |
